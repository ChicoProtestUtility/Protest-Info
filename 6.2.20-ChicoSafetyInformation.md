# Protest Safety Information:

### <u>NEVER:</u>

- Listen to the request of anyone to cause damage to others or property, it has been shown that undercover police will attempt to encourage protesters to do so

- Wear clothing that makes you highly identifiable, or clothing that you aren't comfortable throwing away

  *(More details can be found in the **Tear Gas** section)*

- Go to a protest completely alone.

  - If this is unable to be avoided, attempt to form a group with those already at the protest.

- Give up information to individuals you don't know or trust such as:

  - Your name
  - Who organized the protest
  - What organization you're with

### <u>Always:</u>

- Have an exit plan/route/safer area that you can move to if needed.

- Be aware of the current position that law enforcement is in.

  - Use this to constantly update your exit plan/route/safer area as the protest continues.

- Be ready to move to the safer area.

- Be aware of police forming a full perimeter of the protest.

  - If this happens, it may be wise to begin your exit from the protest location and move to your safer area or exit route.

  *The above statements can become invaluable if any escalation occurs.*

- Tell an individual that you trust that you are going to a protest.
- Know the difference between small talk and attempts by undercover police to acquire information from you.
- Remember what motivated you to attend, and attempt to reflect on it daily for as long as you can.



### <u>Tear Gas:</u>

- **If tear gas is deployed:**

  - <u>Safely</u> get to higher ground, most tear gases are heavier than air and tend to stay low to the ground
  - <u>**Only if you are able to prepare your mask before any tear gas powder is deployed**</u>: you can <u>lightly</u> moisten the outside of the mask in the hopes that the powder activates on the mask rather than on your skin.
    - <u>**THIS CAN HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT IF DONE IMPROPERLY, SEE STATEMENT BELOW**</u> 
    - If you were to apply a face cover where both sides of the mask are moist, or if you accidentally moisten your own face in the process, then the effects of the tear gas can be increased.
  - <u>If you are able to</u> predict when the tear gas will be deployed, attempt to remove any and all moisture from your exposed skin. This will slow the activation process and result in less irritation

- **If you are exposed to tear gas:**

  - The powder <u>will</u> stick to your clothing, avoid as much contact between your exposed clothing and non-exposed objects as possible.
  - The powder may take multiple washings to fully remove, be careful when you put the clothes back on to avoid re-exposing yourself.
    - Individuals have reported experiences where the powder either took months to remove or was never able to be successfully removed.
  - Wash exposed skin with regular shower soap and <u>start with cold water and slowly increase the temperature</u>. 
    - If powder can be seen on your exposed skin, avoid letting the runoff water from reaching sensitive areas.

- **If you have known respiratory issues like asthma:**

  - Please understand that you are at a greater risk of harm, tear gas can cause the body to produce an excess of mucus which can increase respiratory issues.

- **It is delivered by grenade style canister or hand held spray bottle.**

  - <u>Cannisters generate a massive amount of heat when used. While the videos of people throwing them back at police are pretty badass, protect your hands if you intend to touch one</u>.

- **The powder that causes the disorientation and burning sensation requires moisture, having the following on your body may lead to excess irritation:**

  - Sunscreen
  - Sweat
  - Makeup
  - Contact-lenses

  

### <u>Undercover Police:</u>

*NONE OF THE INFORMATION BELOW IS A SUREFIRE INDICATOR THAT THAT PARTICULAR VEHICLE/PERSON IS UNDERCOVER. REFRAIN FROM DAMAGING CARS OR MISTREATING WELL MEANING PROTESTERS JUST BECAUSE THEY MEET THE DESCRIPTIONS. Id hate to hear about someone's car being destroyed or someone being beat up just because it might have been undercover car or individual*.

- It is well known that undercover police are commonplace at protests, understanding the threats that they bring as well as how to identify them is important.

- This section does not aim to be a tool to harass or damage those who may find themselves fitting the below description, and is instead a tool for identification and avoidance.

- **Signs of undercover police presence:**

  - Vehicles:

    - *unmarked* Ford Crown Victoria

    - *unmarked* Dodge Charger Pursuit

    - *unmarked* Chevrolet Impala

    - *unmarked* Hummer H3

    - Cars with an excess of antennas or lights attached to them

    - Cars with highly tinted windows

      

  - Individuals:

    - Unnecessary oversized jackets
    - Wearing brand new clothing (specifically hoodies) to a protest
    - Cargo pants/shorts
    - Military or hiking style boots
    - Outlines of equipment such as armor or weapons able to be seen on shirts
    - Wearing a nondescript but identifiable arm band.

- **If you believe you have identified an undercover police officer:**

  - DO NOT immediately assume you've properly identified an undercover officer, remember that many protesters will fit these descriptions. This is an avoidance tool, not an escalation tool.
  - DO NOT make a scene or harass them, this will escalate the situation further. Whether you agree with what they are a part of or not, escalating the situation will make the situation worse for your fellow protesters quickly. 
  - DO NOT ask them if they are an undercover police officer or let them hear you say the words "undercover police". This can allow you and your group to be aware of their presence and stay the safest possible.
  - Rather, inform the group that you're with what you've seen so that they can keep track of the suspected undercover police.
  - Apparently some individuals think that if you ask an undercover police officer if they indeed are an undercover officer, that they need to be honest. <u>***THIS IS IN NO WAY TRUE***</u>
